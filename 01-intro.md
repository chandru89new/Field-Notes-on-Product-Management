# Introductory Note

## Who am I?
I started working as a writer while helping my friend build websites on the side. Eventually, a writing gig turned into a UI/UX role which then turned into a full-fledged product manager/owner role. I had the opportunity to help build four businesses based on web apps in a short span of time. One of them got acquired, one of them is in limbo and the rest are still live and in some sense, kicking.

Through all these, I worked with a really small team of 1-3 developers and really bootstrapped, self-funded budgets.

After this, I got back into coding web apps as a frontend developer (working under product managers) because I love writing code and I wanted to get into the trenches with people I had tried to manage to get a sense of how a product manager looks from the other side.

## Why collate these notes?

My role as a product manager in early-stage, self-funded startups is very universal. A lot of people take on similar responsibilities even if the role is not labeled as such. 

I think these notes may come in handy for others doing similar things in similar circumstances.

## Caveat

I don't intend for this document to be a generalization of principles. This is a collation of field notes from my work experience.

While I hope that these apply to everyone managing developers and building products, I am aware that your circumstances are different and so, some of these may not apply or may be applied with some modifications.
