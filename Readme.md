# Field Notes on Product Management in Tiny, Bootstrapped Startups

This is a collation of notes, observations and opinions that I gathered while working as a product manager (or rather, jack of few trades) in small, bootstrapped startups with a handful of developers.

This existed as a Google document for a long while. In an effort to port it to `git`, I have copied all the contents of the book to this repo.

If you prefer a `.pdf` version, you can [download the ebook here][pdf].

To start reading the book right here on Github, [start here][start].
