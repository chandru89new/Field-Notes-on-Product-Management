# On Becoming (and Being) Customer's Champion

## Using the customer to guide through conflicts of features

Always use the customer as the pole-star / guiding light to resolve conflicts or disagreements arising out of simple things like "how best to solve this bug" or complicated things like "how best to implement this specific feature". Almost everything from scope to time can all be decided by your actual customer's need.

You're managing a team, you're building a product. So it's easy to lose track of the fact that what matters the most (or second-most) is the customer. It is not very surprising how often this happens in the world. So it's your job to be the customer's champion and drive conversations, thought and work towards building something that solves your customer's problem.

## Your developer should think like a customer too

It is not just you that should be a customer's champion. Encourage and prod your team to think like a customer when trying to build.

Developers (especially the backend ones) are so far from customers that their usual and only interaction with a customer is through what they help build, ie the product itself. This makes it hard for them to think about the customer at all times (compared to, say, a UI designer). But it is well worth the effort and time to get everyone to think like a customer and solve through empathy (which, as a term, is over-used these days but it still is a valid thing to build good products).

Many times, core discussions about the nitty-gritty of product development get so carried away that the customer is often left out of the conversation. So every time you get into such a zone, step back and see if the customer's product experience helps in resolving things. You'll find that it does very often.
