# Closing Thoughts

I don't intend for these ideas to be any sort of a generalization: at best, they can be a template for you to use, refine or adapt to your situation. At worst, I hope they're something you can pass on to someone you know who is managing things in a small-sized upstart.

I do implore you, however, to think about your work as a manager. Too often, there's so much work to do that we seldom stop to think about work at a meta level. But it helps. So stop and have your own retrospective analysis of how you work and make necessary course-corrections as you see fit.

I was lucky in this aspect because the first founder I worked with – and who actually put me in charge of managing things – would occasionally talk to me about the meta-things of work on long walks. And looking back, this has helped a lot.

I hope it does to you too.
