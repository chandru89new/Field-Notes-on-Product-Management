# On Workflows

## Checklists to the rescue

I once read that airline pilots – no matter how experienced – always consult a checklist for things like takeoff and landing. That struck a chord and helped me avoid a lot of mishaps.

As a PM, you might most likely do some things regularly – like deploying an app, testing core features after each deploy, a set of documentation/marketing work post-release etc. For each of these things, have a handy checklist that you consult every time you run through the work.

Frequent grunt work can sometimes make us take things for granted (because we think we know it by heart) but it is safer to rely on a piece of paper with the exact steps to follow than trust your brain.

## Becoming a tester

Most startups that set themselves up for fast growth (or hustle) do not employ full-time testers. That role is often relegated to the product manager. 

If you're in such a startup, you have to become excellent at testing. No matter how good your developers are, do not compromise or trust the work till you've tested it yourself.

Checklists come in handy here. When you're building and deploying a feature, think of all possible scenarios to test (especially the error scenarios). An easy/obvious pro-tip: share the list with your team and you'll get more interesting scenarios to test.

Sometimes, your CEO (or your immediate higher-up) might ask you to rush through when deadlines loom. My advice is not to compromise testing time. Do it as thoroughly as if there was all the time in the world. It is better to launch with a known bug than with an unknown bug.

## Context switching

Context switching is the default state of work for any PM. More so if you're in a small startup with few people so you're taking up more work across multiple responsibilities (customer interaction, wireframes, operations, marketing etc).

It takes a toll even if you manage your time well and switch contexts efficiently. There are no hard and fast rules here. You just evolve your own set of rules over time.

Two things to note:

One, spend a large chunk of time in a particular context instead of switching fast. Let your team know that you won't be instantly available for questions for some periods of time. This helps you do the deep work necessary.

Two, context switching is a PM's default, not a developer's or a designer's. Do not ask developers status updates on a task that they're supposed to work on at a later time. Try as much as possible to avoid asking people working on your team to switch to another task (unless it's super urgent and mission-critical).
