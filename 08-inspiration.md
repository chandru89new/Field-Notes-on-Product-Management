# On Being Inspired

## Reading diversity

Management is a vast subject and when careers are made out of that, you'd expect a sizeable chunk of literature about it. Which is perhaps why a lot of people spend a lot of time reading up about management.

I've found more valuable information (and wisdom) from what appear to be unrelated fields. Fiction, Rumi's quatrains, zen parables, literary process of great writers, comic strips, architectural design magazines have all provided some great, valuable lessons that I've applied (or tried to) while managing products.

Being too restricted about your reading sources and reading variety (ie, when you only follow a lot of management/product blogs, read mostly Ryan Holiday and the ilk etc) can also lead to boredom.

Spread your reading topics. Be perennially curious about almost everything. Diversity in reading is one of the best things to have. Not only does it supply you with fresh fodder for daily inspiration, it also saves you on the day you're bored, uninspired or depressed.

## Not becoming too focused on problem-solving

If you spend 8-10 hours a day solving one problem after another, it tends to permeate your general thinking. You might (very possibly) start seeing almost everything in life with a problem-solution mindset.

As cliche as it sounds, you have to step back.

This is not a line about work-life balance. For some passionate souls, there are no distinctions between work and life. What I do mean, however, is that you should not get too cozy with or attached to the mental models you accumulate / craft over time as a product manager.

It is true that the app you're helping build is not the whole world. And it is good to step back and reiterate that fact to yourself often.

## Side-projects as an avenue

For some, a lot of management throughout the day can feel like nothing actually got done (by you). Which actually might be true, because you're not building things. This leads to a dreaded sense of not actually doing something productive, creative or useful.

The first time I took up managing a product feature, I was also the UI person. After the UI handover, my creative output was pretty much zero. All I had to do was manage, test, and repeat the two. It felt very depressing after a point.

I inadvertently found a way to trump this depressive bout by working on a few side-projects I had cooked up at the time.

If you're more of a creative person who likes to create/produce things than manage things but you find yourself managing things, perhaps a side-project or two will help.

Side-projects give you the satisfaction of building something. 

## Meditation (or "planned pauses")

Just pause everything, sit in a comfortable position, breath deeply and try to think of nothing. Every once in a while. Or every day (which is better).

## Writing as a form of thought-processing

Much has been written about writing itself. From a personal experience, writing helps me refine my thoughts, ideas, opinions and eventually actions.

Writing is not as fast as thinking but where it lacks in speed, it compensates in refinement. We think fast, sometimes too fast, and tend to overlook certain things. Writing mostly fixes this. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen many sides of a thing just because I was writing down some ideas about it.

Writing brings clarity but even more than that, it brings you new solutions that you might easily have overlooked if you were to just talk or think.

I have a workday-journal where I jot down the day's work (as bullet points) along with some thoughts that must've sprung up through the workday. These help me a lot. And I have a feeling writing will help you too.
