## Being curious about other aspects of your company

In big companies with an army of people building things, roles get well-defined scopes. A product manager might get to hear from customer support but may never get to learn the intricacies of the business finances. This is a luxury available only in really small teams. If you're in one, be curious about every department, every work in your company.

And it is a luxury indeed. As a PM, your work becomes better when you factor in many aspects of the business.

Knowing first-hand how a marketing person writes or knowing intricately how some system is setup comes in handy. For example, knowing the limitations of our code (through routine discussions with my backend developer) helped me in almost all future instances when we had to implement new features.
