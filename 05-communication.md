# On Communication

## Repetition of basic assumptions helps

Every startup I've worked in has had this problem where, in the middle of a long discussion or debate, someone realizes that their assumptions (of initial variables, or preconditions or basic facts) were wrong (or different from those of others). And that solves most of the other things being debated.

It is better – always – to clarify the things you assume before you go about asking details or giving out instructions.

When someone asks you a question, trace back a few steps ("why is this person asking this question?" helps) and confirm with the person that your assumptions about it are right. Be on the same page before you give out an answer.

## Having a specific time to ping

A TL;DR version of this would be: don't breathe down the neck of your team often unless they aren't doing their work on time.

A simple principle that I've used is this: I ask the person I'm delegating a task to how long they estimate the task to go. If it's anywhere between an hour to half-a-day, I do not ping them till fifteen minutes after the estimated time is over. If the estimate is a day or more, I ping them at the half-way mark just to ensure they're on track or get an update on why they're not (if they're not) to help with any blockers.

When I worked as a developer under a PM, he would ping the devs at infrequent intervals, often involving a context switch. That took a toll on all the devs. Do not do this because it breaks the rhythm of the devs and it also costs a lot of time to get back into the groove.

## Learning the circadian rhythm of the people on your team

This bit of information probably is helpful when your team is distributed across the world. 

When you work with other people, especially devs, you should make a note of their most-active and least-active times. Sometimes, some devs work best early in the day and some others work best in the dead of the night.

One of the devs was super-productive in the wee hours because his family would be fast asleep. 

Mostly, this doesn't apply to your team if all of you work from an office and work between certain hours of the day. But you might notice that your devs appear to be more productive at certain hours of the workday and use it to your advantage.

Knowing when the people on your team work their best helps because you can assign tasks based on this. 

It's not that this is a fool-proof way to get the best and most productive work done but this is one of those human things that you can't really control. Different people have different "productive" hours and if you're a remote team working different time-zones, this is very useful to know.

## Show before tell

When you explain things to people, try to show visually. This works exceptionally well when you're talking about UI or even UX but it works very well when you're explaining a workflow, a logic, a pattern or anything that can be drawn as a diagram. 

Even a rough sketch speaks more clearly than words transmitted through text or speech. Most people understand better when things are presented visually.

## Conflicts, ego and other "people" problems

Flat hierarchies and open cultures have reduced many problems involving people's egos. Nevertheless, people are people and things get heated up.

Conflicts often emerge when someone ends up implying a blame or blaming someone for a mishap. As a PM, be ready to capture an implied blame and nip it. Often, it's best to absorb responsibility and then talk one-on-one to the person you think / you know caused the rupture about what specific issues they have.

Managing people is the hardest part of being a PM. This gets complicated in flat hierarchies where the role is ill-suited. On the one hand, you're managing the work and its direction like a leader, and on the other hand, no one needs to feel the need to "report" to you (which is an oft-loathed concept in hierarchical orgs). So it's always a rope walk where you are a colleague at the same level as well as a leader of the pack.

At the end of the day (in the most literal sense of that phrase), look back and make sure people on your team know that you recognized the good work done that day or that week. Do not wait for a review meet / retro to congratulate people on their work (even if it's trivial).

## Nurturing a solution mindset

There is one very stark difference I've noticed between people who start businesses and people who take up jobs. People with the entrepreneurial spirit think about solutions. The latter typically think about the problems and do not get to step 2: solutions, until prodden.

When you talk to your team, you're most likely to hear a lot about problems, blockers and complications. It is natural. When asked to explain why some feature is not yet implemented, or a bug not fixed, the likely thing to do is to explain the problem.

One of the unwritten codes of managing a team is to inculcate the solution mindset. Ask your team about their thoughts on solving some problem, some blocker or some complication while they're describing the problem. (This is not to say that you shouldn't listen to their problem description). Encourage them – explicitly – to think and talk about the solutions they're trying/theorizing about more than they do about the problems.

Some of the best work has happened when everyone involved in a product thinks like a problem-solver. That is how almost everyone starts but that trait is honed by constant use; the opposite of it holds true too – if unused, the trait disappears and the person just ends up talking about problems.

Get your team to talk more about solutions. Get your team to ask themselves, "so what's the solution for this?" more often than they do.
