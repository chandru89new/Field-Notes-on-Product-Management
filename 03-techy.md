# On Being a Techy Manager

## Winning the trust of a developer

One of the key things that causes or reduces friction between developers and their managers is this simple but sophisticated idea of trust.

If a developer trusts you, they share more details about their work, and most importantly about the hurdles to and the intricate parts of their work. If they don't trust you (which very typically happens when the manager is not tech-enough for the developer), they almost loathe you for not being empathetic to their problems.

It is not necessary for a non-tech-background manager to learn code and start dishing out full-fledged apps in order to empathize with your developer.

But you need that basic idea about how code is written, how code works and how things come together in code to work towards a common goal in order to understand your developers better. Pick up a book, write some code. You'll have a better understanding of many developer-issues.

## Listening is not a time-suck

In at least two startups, I've heard program/product managers say, "I am not bothered about the implementation" whenever a developer begins describing a blocker or something specific.

Developers are put-off by that. Not always but mostly. 

To be fair to managers and founders, they're running out of time all the time (or it's a case of mismanagement of time). Speaking to managers, I've felt like they feel listening to deeper/longer explanations is a time-suck.

But if you really want to build better relationships with your developer (which has a very direct influence on their productivity and involvement), it is good to listen even if sometimes the developer takes you on a long arc.
Listening is not a time-suck.

## Enabling refactors / removing technical debt

Developers want to refactor some part of their code all the time. Managers always want to set that for later because there's so much to build.

In most cases, this eventually leads to a time where certain things can't be built on top of existing code because of technical debt. Developers feel bad. Disillusionment happens.

Try to give the freedom of choice (and time) to refactor chunks of code to your developer. Instead of doing a major refactor after a year or more of building a product, it is good to add in refactor time at the end of sprints (or a few weeks).

Letting the developer decide their own time and piece of code to refactor is a great morale booster too.

##  Empty pockets of time

Almost none of us works every second of our workday. Some product managers (and founders) think their developers must be doing something for all the hours they're paid for.

It is important to realize that doing nothing (or doing something not related to work) plays a crucial, indirect role in helping people work better.

When your developer sees you as a task master, they seldom tell you they're free (or not working on anything at the moment) in clear terms. Because they know you'll thrust some work right away.
